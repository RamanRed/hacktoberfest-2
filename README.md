Blackjack Game
Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic card game Blackjack. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by having a hand value that is closer to 21 without exceeding it. Players receive two cards initially, and they can choose to "hit" for more cards or "stand" to keep their current hand. The game also incorporates the logic for handling Aces, which can count as either 1 or 11, depending on what benefits the player the most.

Game Rules
Each player starts with two cards.
The goal is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over.
Players can choose to hit (draw another card) or stand (keep their current hand).
Aces can count as 1 or 11.
The dealer reveals one card and plays according to specific rules.
The game ends when the player stands or busts (goes over 21).
Student Guidance
When working on a solution for this project, keep the following ideas in mind:

Card Representation:

Think about how to represent cards and their values. Consider using a list or dictionary for easy access and manipulation.
Game Flow Control:

Consider how to structure the game flow. Ensure that you handle user input effectively and allow for a clear turn sequence.
Handling Aces:

Aces can complicate scoring. Make sure your logic accommodates this by allowing the playerâ€™s hand value to adapt dynamically based on the total.
Input Validation:

Always validate user input to prevent unexpected behavior. Implement checks to ensure that inputs fall within the expected range.
Winning Conditions:

Clearly define how to determine the winner between the player and the dealer. Think about different scenarios, especially when both go over 21.
Code Structure:

Organize your code into functions for clarity and reusability. This will make it easier to debug and maintain.
Testing:

Test your game thoroughly with different scenarios to ensure that all rules and conditions are implemented correctly.
By keeping these ideas in mind, you'll be able to create a robust and enjoyable Blackjack game that not only functions well but is also user-friendly.

Getting Started
